# Internally Opinionated Project Overview

This is the final project for the [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). The design concept is a web app allowing company employees to log in and answer questions created by other employees or create questions which their colleagues can answer. An employee can only see the current results of polls (questions) they have answered. A leaderboard shows the top participant; the employee with the most questions asked and answered.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate an understanding of the fundamentals of React and Redux by building a React-based SPA (single-page application).

Code testing was implemented using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Getting Started

This project requires Node.js. If you do not have it installed on your machine you can find it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Dependencies and Usage

git clone the project and cd into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bantabanta/internally-opinionated.git
cd internally-opinionated
```

Install npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the app in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

You should now see the interactive webapp in your browser. If you don't, simply navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000).

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/cra-template/template/README.md).

## Starter Code

As the goal of this project was to gain a better understanding of React, some starter code was used. The only provided starter code is the `_DATA.js` file which represents a fake database of users questions, as well as methods that let you access the data.
